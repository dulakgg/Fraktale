# Heighway Dragon Curve

## Overview
The Heighway Dragon, also known as the Dragon Curve, is a self-similar fractal that was discovered by NASA physicists John Heighway, Bruce Banks, and William Harter in the 1960s. It is generated by recursively folding a strip of paper in half and unfolding it at right angles.

## Properties
- **Fractal Dimension**: ~1.523
- **Self-Similar**: Composed of scaled-down copies of itself
- **No Self-Intersection**: Despite its complexity, it never crosses itself

## How It Works
1. Start with a straight line.
2. Replace each line segment with two segments that turn at right angles.
3. Repeat the process infinitely.
